Desktop app for teachers: Track student attendance using webcam. Upload student names & portraits for recognition. Students look at the camera upon entering; app records attendance. One-click generates a spreadsheet for teachers to use. Simple and efficient attendance management.

If you would like to use this interface, clone this repository to your PC. Run the "main.py" file to start the app. DO NOT TAMPER WITH INTERNAL FILES OR YOU MAY CAUSE ISSUES. 

Unfortunately for the time-being, only jpg/jpeg files are supported for student portraits being uploaded to the system. 


I hope you find this useful!
